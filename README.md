# Build a Datacenter
### Build a Datacenter that fulfills the 5 requirements
    - Security - (Starting at the Network and moving up) 
    - Operations - (Starting at the Network and moving up)
    - Provisioning and resource management automation
    - Availability
    - Observability

The datacenter is an AWS account. It hosts a modern day SaaS application. We’ll hold a whiteboard session to go over your design of the datacenter. This should include diagrams and drawings. We use Terraform at Socure. Beginning from the VPC, write terraform to show the begluinning of your VPC and how you’d accomplish the 5 above requirements. You don’t need to write the entire datacenter in terraform, just the beginning of the VPC and then any other modules you want to dig into. We’ll talk about all aspects of the design, and more terraform written ahead of time just directs that discussion. 

You should spend no more than 4 hours creating a design, drawing diagrams and flow charts, as well as the base Terraform file. This is meant to be interactive and a starting off point for our panel discussions with the team.
